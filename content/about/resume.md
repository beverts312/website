## Professional Summary

I am a passionate technologist who loves to learn. I am capable of working on any part of the stack at any point in the process. 
Designing scalable development flows/pipelines that start at a commit and end at production is one of my passions. Experienced in the journey to microservices and the procedural and cultural changes that come along with it.
It is my belief that teams and organizations should have open, candid, and respectful
communication so that they can be as effective as possible.
