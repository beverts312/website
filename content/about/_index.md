I love working with technology in both my professional and personal life. I am passionate about the cloud and its ability to allow people to rapidly build and scale. I am passionate about cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies that allow us to build a fair and open ecosystems that can change the world. I am passionate about the internet of things and the amount of things it can allow us to learn more about and/or automate.

This site is my playground, blog, and a place to keep some notes. Any opinions expressed here are my own.
