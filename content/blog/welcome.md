I am passionate about distributed computing and developer productivity. I am comfortable working with linux and windows. I have extensive experience with the major public cloud providers and docker. I am a polygot developer capable of delivering solutions using a variety of programming languages and technologies. I am a strong believer in DevOps principles and agile methodologies.  

##### Personal Life  
I was born in California and grew up in Texas and Alberta (Canada). In December 2013, I received a B.S in Computer Science From Texas Tech University. In the Fall of 2015 I married my wonderful wife Ryan Alyssa Everts. I have 2 cats, 1 dog, and 2 fish tanks. My primary hobby is "technology", I always have multiple hardware/software projects in progress and am always reading/learning about emerging technologies. My other hobbies include rocks, aquariums, and snow boarding.
