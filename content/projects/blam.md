A Serverless Cloud Native Application for managing digital (media) assets. This is a closed source project I use to expirment with new technologies and ideas as well as to manage my own media. I have no plans to open source the overall project but as I add to it I will consider open sourcing individual components. I will likely open this for public use at some point.
